# This file is provided to you as a starting point for the "game_finder.py" program of Assignment 2
# of CSP1150/CSP5110 in Semester 2, 2018.  It aims to give you just enough code to help ensure
# that your program is well structured.  Please use this file as the basis for your assignment work.
# You are not required to reference it.


# The "pass" command tells Python to "do nothing".  It is simply a placeholder to ensure that the starter files run smoothly.
# They are not needed in your completed program.  Replace them with your own code as you complete the assignment.


# Import the required modules.

import tkinter.messagebox
